    <h1>See you later — for Seysey</h1>
    <pre class="msg">Hey, Seysey.
I just wanted to say this isn’t goodbye — it’s just a “see you later.” I know we won’t be able to play or chat like we used to, and honestly, that feels a little sad. But I get it… sometimes things change, and that’s okay.

Still, I’ll never forget the moments we shared — the laughs, the random talks, and the little things that made everything feel lighter. You were one of the reasons my days felt brighter, and I’ll always be thankful for that.

Even if we don’t talk much anymore, I’ll still be here, quietly wishing you the best in everything. Take care of yourself, okay? I hope one day, when things are right again, our paths cross and we get to talk or play once more — maybe like old times, or maybe even better.

So yeah… this isn’t goodbye, Seysey. It’s just “see you later.” 🌙💛</pre>
